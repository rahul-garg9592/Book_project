The narrative then shifts to a loud crash that shakes the house during supper, leading Marthy to become jittery. The narrator calms her down and goes to investigate by riding his mare, Kate, to the back pasture. Upon reaching the top of the hill, he sees a river rushing like Niagara, a cut-out section of timber, and a mysterious, large shiny contraption emitting a burning smell.
